Hey there! I am a grad student of Mathematics, currently investigating the geometry within information theory. Current themes of research:

- Geometry of uniform vector quantization;
- [Information geometry](/information-geometry) of statistical manifolds, with particular focus to discrete distributions;
- Measures of information and divergence between probability distributions;
- Lattices and applications to information sciences

Following [MSC2020](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/msc2020.html), these are roughly translated {`94A17`, `53B12`, `94A15`}.
